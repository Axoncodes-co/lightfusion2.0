As the angle of attack increases further, the airflow separation proceeds forward until the wing stalls completely.\n\nWhen the stall occurs, the airflow on top of the wings breaks away, darg increases and the lift force significantly reduces, and it causes no longers to be able to support the weight of the airplane which results in loss of altitude.\n\nA stall always occurs at the same angle for a given airplane, regardless of the airplane’s airspeed, flight attitude, or weight. Thus, an airplane can be stalled at any airspeed and in any flight attitude.\n\nAnother important thing you should know is a stall does not mean that the airplane’s engine(s) have stopped working or that the airplane is not moving.\n<h2 title=\"Stall Recognition\">Stall Recognition</h2>\nA first the pilot must identify the flight conditions that caused the stall to occur and know how to take the necessary corrective action for stall recovery.

Lift is an upward force formed by the movement of air on top and under the wing of an airplane and it supports the airplane in flight.\n\nThe weight is opposite to the lift force and is formed by the force of gravity.\n\nThrust is generated by the rotation of the airplane propeller in the air, which propels the airplane forward. It should also be noted that the airplane propeller is rotated by the force supplied by the engine.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDrag is against the thrust force and is formed by the movement of the airplane, which limits the speed of the airplane.\n![four forces of flight](/uploads/Four-forces-of-flight.png)\nIn the image above, the arrows that indicate the forces acting on the airplane are often called vectors. The size of the vector is indicated by the length of the vector and the direction of the vector is indicated by the direction of the arrow.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3 title=\"when are the four forces that act on an airplane in equilibrium\">when are the four forces that act on an airplane in equilibrium?</h3>\nIn straight-and-level, unaccelerated flight, The four forces are in equilibrium. The thrust is equal to and opposite to the drag force, and the lift is equal to and opposite to the weight.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong title=\"LIFT\">LIFT</strong>\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the lift force is opposite to the weight. When the airflow hits the airplane wing, this airflow is divided into two parts and passes through the upper surface of the wing and the lower surface of the wing, which due to the special shape of the wing causes low pressure at the top of the wing and high pressure at the lower surface of the wing, and eventually, due to this pressure difference, the lift force appears.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow to understand why the air at the upper surface of the wing is less pressurized than at the lower surface of the wing, we need to study Bernoulli's law to better understand the lift force.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2 title=\"Bernoulli’s Principle\">Bernoulli’s Principle</h2>\nBernoulli’s principle simply stated, says, “ as the velocity of a fluid (air) increases, its internal pressure decreases.”\n\nTo better understand this law and prove it, we use the Venturi tube and test Bernoulli's law with it.\n\n![Venturi tube](/uploads/Venturi-tube.png)\n\nAs you can see in the picture above, the amount of velocity and air pressure is shown at the inlet of the venturi pipe. But when air enters the narrow part of the pipe, the air velocity increases and its pressure decreases, which is easily seen in the picture. Then, after the air passes through the narrow part of the pipe and enters the outlet, the speed and pressure return to the initial state.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTo apply the Bernoulli principle, air does not need to pass through a closed tube. Any surface that changes the airflow creates a venturi effect.\n\nAs you can see in the image below, the shape of the airplane wing is designed in such a way that the upper surface of the airplane wing is similar to the narrow part of the tube and the lower surface is similar to the wide part of the tube. Therefore, when the air hits the front of the airplane wing, the air velocity increases in the upper surface of the wing and its pressure decreases relative to the lower surface of the wing, which causes the lift force to be generated on the airplane wing.\n\nThe pressure difference between the upper and lower surface of the airplane wing is the main source of lift force.\n\n![Four forces of flight](/uploads/Four-forces-of-flight-1.png)\n\n<strong>Newton’s Third Law of Motion</strong>\n\nThe rest of the lift force is generated by the lower surface of the wing because the air deflects downwards when it strikes the lower surface of the wing.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe third law of Newton states that for “every action (force) in nature there is an equal and opposite reaction”.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLet's look at an example together to better understand.\n\nIf we take our hand out of the window of a moving car, our hand will be pulled back. As we know, due to the collision of air with our hand, the air is deflected forward and according to Newton's third law, it causes the opposite and equal force to be produced, which causes our hand to be pulled back. Watch the video for a better understanding.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe examined two important factors in the production of lift force, the Bernoulli principle and Newton's third law. Many other factors determine the lifting capacity of a wing and you will learn about them in the future.\n<h2 title=\"Airfoils\">Airfoils</h2>\nAirfoil is any surface or object, like a wing, fuselage, etc, that creates aerodynamic force when interacting with a moving airflow.\n<h2 title=\"Leading Edge\">Leading Edge</h2>\nThe front part of the aircraft wing, or in other words, the part of the wing where the air first hits when the aircraft is moving.\n\n<h2 title=\"Trailing Edge\">Trailing Edge</h2>\nThe rear part of the aircraft wing, or in other words, the part of the aircraft wing where the two air currents above the wing surface and below the wing surface reconnect and move away from the aircraft wing.\n<h2 title=\"Chord Line\">Chord Line</h2>\nThe chord line is an imaginary straight line drawn between the leading edge to the trailing edge of an airfoil.\n\n![wing](/uploads/wing.png)\n\n<h2 title=\"Camber\">Camber</h2>\nThe camber of an airfoil is the curved shape of their upper and lower surfaces.

But you will soon find that the main part of airplanes are almost the same. In this lesson, we will introduce the main structures of an airplane.\n<h2 title=\"Fuselage\">Fuselage</h2>\nThe <strong title=\"fuselage\">fuselage</strong> is the most important part of the airplane, which has various functions. This is a place for passengers, pilots to sit and carry luggage and supplies. Also, airplane control commands are installed in the cockpit area, where the cockpit itself is installed in the fuselage.\n\nAnother role that the fuselage plays is that all other parts of the airplane, including wings, landing equipment, etc., are connected to the fuselage.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n![Fuselage](/uploads/Fuselage.jpg)\n\n<h2 title=\"Wings\">Wings</h2>\n<strong title=\"airplane wings\">Airplane wings</strong> are the part of the airplane that allows the airplane to take off. Due to the movement of the airplane on the runway, an air current is formed below and on top of the wing of the airplane, which leads to the production of force for the lift. The lift force causes the plane to fly, and we will study and explain this force in the following lessons to better understand it.\n\nThe position of the wings relative to the fuselage:\n<ul>\n \t<li>In terms of the position of the wings relative to the fuselage, there are three types of wings.</li>\n \t<li>Wings that are attached to the upper part of the fuselage, this type of wing is called <strong title=\"high wing\">High Wing</strong>.</li>\n \t<li>Wings that attach to the middle of the fuselage. The name of this group of wings is <strong title=\"mid wing\">Mid Wing</strong>.</li>\n \t<li>Wings that are attached to the lower part of the fuselage. This type of wing is called <strong title=\"low wing\">Low Wing</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\nIt should be noted that airplanes that have one set of wings are called <strong title=\"monoplanes\">Monoplanes</strong>, and if they have two sets of wings, they are called <strong title=\"biplanes\">Biplanes</strong>.\n\n![Airplane wing](/uploads/Wing.jpg)\n\n<h2 title=\"aileron and flap\">Aileron and Flap</h2>\nAilerons are used to allow the pilot to control and direct the wings during flight. These two moving parts are connected at Trailing-Edge or Rear and near the wing edge to the outside of the airplane. Ailerons are driven by the control lever in the pilot's hand. It should be noted that ailerons move against each other. For example, if the right aileron moves up, the left aileron moves down. This allows the pilot to steer the airplane around a horizontal axis, which we will explain in detail in later lessons. In this lesson, just remember that the aileron is a part of the airplane wing that gives the wings control.\n\nThe flaps are also attached to the wing of the airplane. The flaps attach at the trailing edge of the wing and near the fuselage. Flaps are used when the airplane takes off from the runway and lands at the airport because they increase the cross-section of the wing. Unlike ailerons, the flaps move in the same direction, For example, if the right flap moves down, the left flap moves down in the same direction, and vice versa. Flaps are controlled by the pilot from inside the cockpit.\n\nIn this lesson, just know that the flap is the part of the wing that is used during landing and taking off. We will examine the flaps in detail in the following lessons.\n\n![Aileron](/uploads/Aileron.jpg)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n![Flap](/uploads/Flap.jpg)\n<h2 title=\"Empennage\">Empennage</h2>\nThe whole end of the airplane is called the <strong title=\"empennage\">empennage</strong>, which you can see in the image below. Empennage consists of two parts, the <strong title=\"vertical stabilizer\">vertical stabilizer</strong> or fin, and the <strong title=\"horizontal stabilizer\">horizontal stabilizer</strong>. We have all played darts and seen the blades at the end of the darts. The blades at the end of the dart make the dart stable at the time of throwing and do not change suddenly.\n\nThe vertical stabilizer and horizontal stabilizer on the plane play the role of stabilizing the airplane like darts. Simply keep the airplane in a certain direction and does not change direction suddenly during flight, because the airplane has a vertical stabilizer and a horizontal stabilizer.\n\n![Empennage](/uploads/Empennage.jpg)\n\n![Vertical Stabilizer](/uploads/Vertical-Stabilizer.jpg)\n\n![Horizontal Stabilizer](/uploads/Horizontal-Stabilizer.jpg)\n<h3 title=\"Rudder and Elevator\">Rudder and Elevator</h3>\nThe rudder is attached to the end of the vertical stabilizer. The rudder is controlled by two pedals located under the pilot's foot. Unlike the vertical stabilizer, this part is not fixed and is movable. It should be noted that the rudder allows the pilot to tilt the nose of the airplane to the left or right during flight.\n\nRudder and aileron are also used in combination when bypassing the airplane so that the airplane can experience a smooth lap. (Additional explanations will be provided in the relevant lesson).\n\nIn this lesson, just know that the radar is in the empennage section and is connected to the vertical stabilizer, allowing the pilot to tilt the nose of the airplane to the right and left. Let's take a look at how to use radar and additional explanations in the rudder lesson.\n\nThe elevator is attached to the end of the horizontal stabilizer, and unlike the horizontal stabilizer, it is not stationary and moves. The elevator is controlled by the control lever in the pilot's hand, allowing the pilot to move the nose of the airplane up and down. (We will provide additional explanations and a complete review of the elevator in the relevant lesson).\n\n![Rudder](/uploads/Rudder.jpg)\n\n![Elevator](/uploads/Elevator.jpg)\n\n<h2 title=\"Landing Gear\">Landing Gear</h2>\nLike a car that needs wheels to move on the ground, the airplane uses the landing gear to move on the ground, and also the landing gear bears the weight of the airplane when landing. Light airplanes and Ultralight airplanes usually have three wheels. The main wheels are located on either side of the fuselage, known as the <strong title=\"main wheel\">Main Wheel</strong>.\n\nThe third wheel can be installed both under the nose of the airplane and at the tail of the airplane. If the third wheel is installed in the nose of the airplane, it is called <strong title=\"Nose Wheel\">Nose Wheel</strong> and its design is known as <strong title=\"Tricycle Gear\">Tricycle Gear</strong>.\n\nIf the third wheel is installed at the rear of the airplane, it is called the <strong title=\"Tail Wheel\">Tail Wheel</strong> and its design is known as the <strong title=\"Conventional Landing Gear\">Conventional Landing Gear</strong>. It should be noted that in general, landing gears are divided into two types, <strong>Fixed Gear</strong> and <strong>Retractable Gear</strong>. Simply put, there are airplanes that the pilot cannot pick up landing gear during the flight, and the landing gear is constantly out, like Cessna 172. There are also airplanes that can pick up the landing gear after taking off from the runway, like heavy airplanes or Beechcraft Baron 58.\n\n![Landing Gear](/uploads/Landing-Gear.jpg)\n<h3 title=\"Shock Struts\">Shock Struts</h3>\nWe all know that the car has springs and shock absorbers. The purpose of the spring and shock absorber design for the car is to absorb the force applied by the ground and bumps so that the car is not damaged in the long run.\n\nAirplanes, like cars, use shock absorbers so that the airplane is not damaged by the force applied to the fuselage when moving on the ground and during landing. In aviation, these shock absorbers are known as <strong>Shock Struts</strong>.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3 title=\"Brakes\">Brakes</h3>\nThe brake of an airplane is almost the same as the brake structure of a car, but slightly different. In airplanes, brakes are usually mounted on two main wheels.\n\nAs you know, brakes are applied by one pedal in cars, but usually, in airplanes, brakes are applied by two pedals. This means that you can apply the brakes to the right wheel and the left wheel separately as desired, this system is known as <strong title=\"differential braking\">Differential Braking</strong>.\n\nAirplanes with differential braking systems can better bypass the runway or airport ramp because you can apply full braking to one wheel while the other wheel is completely free and can move easily.\nFor example, if your plane has a differential braking system and you want to make a deep turn to the right, you can prevent it from moving by applying brakes to the right wheel, while the left wheel is free and can move easily. This will allow your plane to turn deep and comfortable to the right.\n\n![Shock Strut and Brake](/uploads/Shock-Strut-and-Brake.jpg)\n<h2 title=\"Power Plant\">Power Plant</h2>\nIn small airplanes, the power plant consists of the engine and the propeller.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3 title=\"Engine\">Engine</h3>\nThe main function of the airplane engine is to power the propeller into circulation. Other functions of the plane engine include generating <em>electrical power</em>, <em>vacuum sources for flight equipment</em>, and <em>heating energy for airplane heaters</em>.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3 title=\"Propeller\">Propeller</h3>\nThe propeller is rotated by the force supplied by the airplane engine, and as a result of this rotation, the propeller creates the <strong>thrust force</strong>, which allows the airplane to move forward. We will talk about propeller and thrust in the next lessons.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3 title=\"Firewall\">Firewall</h3>\nA firewall is the part of the power plant on which the airplane engine is mounted. Other functions of the firewall include removing the cockpit and protecting the pilots from the power plant.\n<h3 title=\"Cowling\">Cowling</h3>\nThe cowling protects the airplane engine from rain, dust, as well as a sudden drop in engine temperature.\n\n![airplane engine](/uploads/airplane-engine.jpg)","Title":"The main structure of airplanes","Excerpt":"In this lesson, we will examine the main structure of an airplane, such as the wing, fuselage, airplane engine, and other important structures.","Slug":"main-structure-of-airplanes","createdAt":"2023-05-18T14:33:06.263Z","updatedAt":"2023-05-18T14:33:07.943Z","publishedAt":"2023-05-18T14:33:07.927Z","course":{"data":{"id":17,"attributes":{"Title":"Principles of Flight","Description":null,"Slug":"principles-of-flight","createdAt":"2023-05-18T13:37:34.593Z","updatedAt":"2023-05-18T13:38:40.855Z","publishedAt":"2023-05-18T13:38:40.851Z","SEO":{"id":24,"metaTitle":"Aviation with our Principles of Flight PPL Course","metaDescription":"Learn the principles of flight for your general aviation PPL.

On other hand, a temperature inversion occurs when a layer of warm air traps cool air near the Earth's surface.\n\nThis is exactly the opposite of what usually happens. Most of the time, the surface of the earth is warm during the day and as the altitude increases, the air temperature decreases, but in an inversion, the air becomes warmer with the increase in altitude.\n<h2>Conditions for the formation of temperature inversion</h2>\n1- <strong>Stable air</strong>\n\n2- <strong>calm or light wind</strong>\n\n3- <strong>Cool or cold night</strong>\n\n4- <strong>clear sky</strong>\n<h2>Types of temperature inversion</h2>\n<ol>\n \t<li><strong>Ground or radiation inversion(terrestrial radiation)</strong>: This is the most common type of temperature inversion, which occurs over land and in cloudless and windless nights.\nDuring the night, the earth loses its heat through terrestrial radiation and cools the surrounding air, as a result, the lower part of the atmosphere becomes colder than the upper air and causes a temperature inversion.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Turbulence or vertical advection inversion</strong>: This type of inversion occurs when a layer of stagnant air sits atop a layer of turbulent air. The turbulent layer transports heat downward, cooling its upper layer through a process called vertical mixing. However, the layer of stagnant air remains unmixed and is therefore warmer than the air below it.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Subsidence inversion</strong>: When a large layer of air descends due to high pressure, it warms up rapidly(adiabatically), while the air at lower altitudes remains cooler, creating a subsidence inversion.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Frontal inversion</strong>: This type of inversion occurs when warm and cold air masses meet. The cold air is denser than the warm air, so it forces the warm air to rise. This can create a temperature inversion, with the warm air above the colder air.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>The effect of temperature inversion in aviation</h2>\nTemperature inversion is one of the important factors in the formation of low clouds, smog, fog, lack of precipitation and impaired visibility. Here's how temperature inversions affect aviation and our environment:\n<ol>\n \t<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol>\n \t<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol>\n \t<li><strong>Poor visibility</strong>: Due to the absence of wind and cold air being trapped under the warm air, the moisture in the air condenses and forms fog and low clouds. Also, due to the lack of air rising to higher altitudes, we see the accumulation of dust and air pollution at lower levels, and its combination with fog causes the formation of smog. All these cases reduce visibility, which is important in aviation.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Rainfall</strong>: Temperature inversions can cause the formation of low clouds that are trapped at lower altitudes due to a lack of upward air movement. This prevents the clouds from rising to higher altitudes where they could release their moisture as precipitation. As a result, precipitation may not occur in areas affected by temperature inversions.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Wind Shear</strong>: Temperature inversion may cause wind shear. Wind shear can be a significant hazard to aircraft, as it can cause a sudden change in wind speed and or direction horizontally or vertically at any level, so it can affect the stability and control of the aircraft. Wind shear can also cause turbulence, which can be uncomfortable for passengers and crew and can potentially cause  serious damage to the aircraft.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Tornadoes and thunderstorms</strong>: Temperature inversions may cause severe thunderstorms and tornadoes due to energy trapped in the atmosphere.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Air p</strong><b>ollution</b>: When a temperature inversion occurs, it can trap smoke, fog, dust, mist, and other particulate pollutants in the troposphere, <strong>reducing pilot's visibility</strong>. Also, trapped pollutants can also react with each other to form harmful chemicals such as smog. Smog is a mixture of air pollutants that can be harmful to human health if inhaled.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Effect of temperature inversion on aircraft performance</h3>\nThe temperature inversion is important on the performance of the aircraft during take-off and landing, and in this section we mention its most important effects.\n<h4>During takeoff</h4>\n<ol>\n \t<li><strong>Reduced rate of climb and lift</strong>: In the take-off phase of the aircraft, temperature inversion reduces the rate of climb and the production of lift force by the wings, because after take-off the air becomes warmer than the surface of the earth, as a result, the density of the air decreases and this affects the performance of the aircraft.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Increased drag</strong>: It can cause the air to be more turbulent, which can increase drag on the aircraft. This can make it more difficult for the aircraft to achieve and maintain the necessary airspeed for takeoff.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Increased risk of wind shear</strong>: A temperature inversion can cause the wind to change direction or speed as it passes through the inversion layer. This can create wind shear, which can be a significant hazard to aircraft, as it can cause a sudden change in lift and drag.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>During Landing</h4>\n<ol>\n \t<li><strong>Increased rate of descend reduced aircraft performance</strong>: During landing, if the wind above the inversion layer is 25 knots or more and the wind below this layer is calm, it can cause the aircraft to lose its performance and lift force when passing through the inversion layer and cause the plane to sink severely.\nTherefore, in order for the pilots to safely enter and pass through this layer, they must first increase the throttle and then enter this layer so that the performance of the aircraft does not decrease.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Visibility</strong>: Usually in temperature inversions due to fog, haze and air pollution, we see reduced visibility for pilots, which can increase the risk of a missed approach or go-around.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Glide Path</strong>: Temperature inversions can affect air density and cause the aircraft to deviate from its glide path, which may result in long or short landings.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Turbulence</strong>: in a temperature inversion, the air close to the earth's surface is stable, which causes turbulence in the higher layers. so, the aircraft face difficult conditions during landing which is dangerous for the pilots to control the aircraft easily.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Engine performance</strong>: Inversion can reduce the amount of oxygen available to the aircraft's engine and significantly affect engine performance and power during approach and landing. Therefore, consideration of engine power during landing in temperature inversion should be considered. (When there is an inversion layer, it can prevent the air from rising and mixing, which can result in a reduction of oxygen availability)</li>\n</ol>","Title":"Temperature Inversion","Excerpt":"In this lesson we will examine what is temperature inversion and the effect of that in aviation.","Slug":"temperature-inversion","createdAt":"2023-05-18T14:35:30.981Z","updatedAt":"2023-05-18T14:35:33.226Z","publishedAt":"2023-05-18T14:35:33.221Z","course":{"data":{"id":18,"attributes":{"Title":"Meteorology","Description":null,"Slug":"meteorology","createdAt":"2023-05-18T13:39:57.097Z","updatedAt":"2023-05-18T13:50:25.032Z","publishedAt":"2023-05-18T13:40:00.547Z","SEO":{"id":25,"metaTitle":"Master Meteorology for PPL: Comprehensive Courses & Exam","metaDescription":"Prepare for Meteorology in General Aviation PPL with our expert courses and exam materials.

Therefore, as the air pressure decreases, the temperature also decreases and vice versa.\n<h2>Types of lapse rate</h2>\n<h3>Dry adiabatic lapse rate</h3>\nAs we know, atmospheric pressure decreases with increasing altitude and the volume of a parcel of air expands with increasing altitude and conversely, if a parcel of air descends from a higher altitude to a lower altitude, its volume is compressed at lower levels due to the higher atmospheric pressure.\n\nThe <em>adiabatic lapse rate</em> (ALR) is the rate at which the temperature of an air parcel changes due to the expansion or compression process associated with a change in altitude in the Earth's atmosphere, if no heat is lost or gained (exchanged) with the surrounding air during this process.\n\nThe Earth's atmosphere is not always completely free of water vapor, or moisture in the air. There are times when the air contains as much water vapor as it can hold, and this is called saturated air, or air with a relative humidity of 100%. However, there are also times when the air contains less water vapor than it is capable of holding, and this is called unsaturated air, or air with a relative humidity of less than 100%. The dry adiabatic lapse rate refers to the rate at which unsaturated air cools as it rises and expands. It is also sometimes referred to as the dry adiabat, DALR, or unsaturated lapse rate. It's important to note that \"dry\" in this context does not mean that there is no water vapor present in the air, but rather that there is no liquid water present. Water vapor can still be present in dry air.\n<h3>Wet adiabatic lapse rate</h3>\nWhen an air parcel that is not fully saturated with water vapor rises from the Earth's surface, it will cool at a rate of about -9.8 degrees Kelvin per kilometer (-5.4 degrees Fahrenheit per 1000 feet) as it expands. This rate of cooling is known as the dry adiabatic lapse rate. Eventually, the air parcel will cool to a temperature at which the water vapor it contains will begin to condense and turn into liquid water. This temperature is known as the atmospheric dew point.\n\nWhen the air parcel reaches the dew point, it becomes fully saturated with water vapor, and the rate of cooling will slow down. This slower rate of cooling is known as the wet adiabatic lapse rate, which is also sometimes referred to as the wet adiabat, saturated lapse rate, SALR, moist adiabatic lapse rate, or MALR. This slowing down of the cooling rate is due to the release of latent heat as the water vapor condenses into liquid water.\n\nThe wet adiabatic lapse rate, which is the rate at which temperature decreases with altitude when an air parcel is rising and releasing heat through condensation, is not constant. This is because it depends on the amount of water vapor present in the air when it starts to rise. The amount of heat that can be released through condensation varies with the amount of water vapor present, so the wet adiabatic lapse rate also varies.\n\nIn the troposphere, the wet adiabatic lapse rate can range from about 4 K/kilometer (2.2 °F/1000 ft) in regions where the ambient temperature is about 25 °C (77 °F) to about 7 K/kilometre (3.8 °F/1000 ft) in regions where the ambient temperature is about – 10 °C (14 °F).\n\nWhen an air parcel reaches its dew point and the rate of cooling slows to the wet adiabatic lapse rate, it will continue to rise until all of its water vapor has condensed. At this point, the rate of cooling will revert back to the dry adiabatic lapse rate.\n<h3>Environmental lapse rate</h3>\nThe dry adiabatic lapse rate and wet adiabatic lapse rate are ideas about how temperature changes with altitude under certain conditions. In reality, the temperature at different altitudes in a specific place at a specific time is called the environmental lapse rate, which can also be referred to as the ELR, prevailing lapse rate, or ambient lapse rate.","Title":"Lapse Rate","Excerpt":"In this lesson, we will examine what is Lapse Rate and also we will talk about adiabatic, wet, environmental lapse rate and the difference between positive and negative lapse rate.","Slug":"lapse-rate","createdAt":"2023-05-18T14:37:21.331Z","updatedAt":"2023-05-18T14:37:24.410Z","publishedAt":"2023-05-18T14:37:24.404Z","course":{"data":{"id":18,"attributes":{"Title":"Meteorology","Description":null,"Slug":"meteorology","createdAt":"2023-05-18T13:39:57.097Z","updatedAt":"2023-05-18T13:50:25.032Z","publishedAt":"2023-05-18T13:40:00.547Z","SEO":{"id":25,"metaTitle":"Master Meteorology for PPL: Comprehensive Courses & Exam","metaDescription":"Prepare for Meteorology in General Aviation PPL with our expert courses and exam materials.

Also, at the same time, some ions and electrons collide and return to normal and neutral molecules and atoms.\n\nDuring the day, due to the presence of sunlight, more ions are produced than the ions that are lost, so we see an increase in ions in the three ionosphere regions.\n\nDuring the day, due to the presence of sunlight, more ions are produced compared to ions that return to normal form, so ions increase in the three ionosphere regions.\n\nDuring the night, due to the lack of sunlight, the ions combine with the electrons thus their number decreases rapidly until the D region disappears completely and the E region becomes very weak. But every morning, due to the presence of X-rays and ultraviolet light from the sun in the D and E regions, the ions increase again.\n\n![Ionosphere layer](/uploads/ionosphere-layer.png)\n<h3 title=\"Ionosphere temperature\">Ionosphere temperature</h3>\nIn the <a title=\"structure and composition of the Earth's atmosphere\" href=\"https://homapilot.com/general/meteorology/earth-atmosphere-composition-and-structure/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">structure and composition of the Earth's atmosphere</a>, we examined the temperature in different layers of the atmosphere. As we know, the ionosphere starts from the upper part of the mesosphere and extends to the top of the thermosphere.\n\nConsequently, the ionosphere has dissimilar temperatures in different parts of the Earth's atmosphere, so that in the upper part of the mesosphere its temperature reaches -90 degrees Celsius (-130 Fahrenheit) and in the upper part of the thermosphere its temperature reaches about 2000 degrees Celsius (3632 Fahrenheit).\n<h3 title=\"Why is the ionosphere important\">Why is the ionosphere important?</h3>\nThe ionosphere is useful in many ways. The ionosphere protects organisms and living things on the earth by absorbing ultraviolet light. Also, the ionosphere reflects radio waves emitted from the earth and bounces them back toward the earth.\n\n![Why does the ionosphere reflect radio waves](/uploads/Why-does-the-ionosphere-reflect-radio-waves.png)\n&nbsp;\n<h3 title=\"Why does the ionosphere reflect radio waves\">Why does the ionosphere reflect radio waves?</h3>\nThe ionosphere contains large amounts of free electrons that affect the propagation of radio waves. When high frequency (HF) radio waves hit free electrons in the ionosphere cause them to vibrate and re-radiate energy with the same frequency to the Earth. This ionosphere feature has long been used to enable long-distance radio communications.","Title":"The Ionosphere","Excerpt":"In the Earth Atmosphere Composition and Structure lesson, we examined the <strong title=\"ionosphere\">ionosphere</strong> in general, but in this lesson, we will study the ionosphere more comprehensively.","Slug":"ionosphere","createdAt":"2023-05-18T14:47:56.873Z","updatedAt":"2023-05-18T14:48:01.691Z","publishedAt":"2023-05-18T14:48:01.683Z","course":{"data":{"id":14,"attributes":{"Title":"Articles","Description":null,"Slug":"articles","createdAt":"2023-04-25T16:34:34.963Z","updatedAt":"2023-04-25T16:55:21.887Z","publishedAt":"2023-04-25T16:34:49.150Z","SEO":{"id":19,"metaTitle":"articles meta title meta title meta title meta","metaDescription":"articles meta descriptions meta descriptions meta descriptions meta descriptions meta descriptions","keywords":"articles","canonicalURL":null},"category":{"data":null}}}},"SEO":{"id":36,"metaTitle":"why is the ionosphere important | Homa Pilot","metaDescription":"In this article we will look at the definition of ionosphere, where is the ionosphere located and why is the ionosphere important.","keywords":"The ionosphere","canonicalURL":null,"metaImage":{"data":{"id":92,"attributes":{"name":"The-Ionosphere.jpg","alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"width":1920,"height":548,"formats":{"large":{"ext":".jpg","url":"/uploads/large_The-Ionosphere.jpg","hash":"large_The-Ionosphere","mime":"image/jpeg","name":"large_The-Ionosphere.jpg","path":null,"size":10.82,"width":1000,"height":285},"small":{"ext":".jpg","url":"/uploads/small_The-Ionosphere.jpg","hash":"small_The-Ionosphere","mime":"image/jpeg","name":"small_The-Ionosphere.jpg","path":null,"size":4.17,"width":500,"height":143},"medium":{"ext":".jpg","url":"/uploads/medium_The-Ionosphere.jpg","hash":"medium_The-Ionosphere","mime":"image/jpeg","name":"medium_The-Ionosphere.jpg","path":null,"size":7.14,"width":750,"height":214},"thumbnail":{"ext":".jpg","url":"/uploads/thumbnail_The-Ionosphere.jpg","hash":"thumbnail_The-Ionosphere","mime":"image/jpeg","name":"thumbnail_The-Ionosphere.jpg","path":null,"size":1.78,"width":245,"height":70}},"hash":"The-Ionosphere","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":108.84,"url":"/uploads/The-Ionosphere.jpg","previewUrl":null,"provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"createdAt":"2023-04-27T09:30:07.207Z","updatedAt":"2023-04-27T09:30:07.207Z"}}}},"users_permissions_user":{"data":{"id":2,"attributes":{"username":"benyamin","email":"amiribenyamin1@gmail.com","provider":"local","confirmed":true,"blocked":false,"createdAt":"2023-04-14T03:54:18.016Z","updatedAt":"2023-04-25T10:44:39.915Z","display_name":null,"Avatar":{"data":{"id":70,"attributes":{"name":"9072eddbf368796db0ec4604229c7829.jpeg","alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"width":96,"height":96,"formats":null,"hash":"9072eddbf368796db0ec4604229c7829_c8a4066d7b","ext":".jpeg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":4.77,"url":"/uploads/9072eddbf368796db0ec4604229c7829_c8a4066d7b.jpeg","previewUrl":null,"provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"createdAt":"2023-04-25T09:10:15.841Z","updatedAt":"2023-04-25T09:10:15.841Z"}}}}}},"Previous":{"data":null},"Next":{"data":null}}},{"id":15,"attributes":{"Content":"<h2 title=\"Noctilucent Clouds Definition\">Noctilucent Clouds Definition</h2>\nVery thin clouds composed of water ice crystals that are located in the <a title=\"Mesosphere\" href=\"https://homapilot.com/general/meteorology/earth-atmosphere-composition-and-structure/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Mesosphere</em></a> layer at an altitude of 75 to 90 km above the Earth's surface are called <strong title=\"noctilucent clouds\">noctilucent clouds</strong>.
